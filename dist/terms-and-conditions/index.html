General Provisions</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>These Terms &amp; Conditions shall apply to all contracts concluded between the Translator (Simone Robinson) and the Client and supersede any terms and conditions referred to, relied on or offered by the Client, unless the Translator has agreed otherwise in writing.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>Should the Client act on behalf of a third party, the Translator enters into the contract with the Client only and not with the third party that may be the Client’s end customer. The Client shall fulfil his/her payment obligations detailed in section 8 of these Terms &amp; Conditions, irrespective of payments effected by the Client’s end customer or other third parties.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>Contracts between the Translator and the Client shall be governed in all respects by Swiss law.</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>All communications concerning translation and/or proofreading services shall be in either English, German or French.</p></div><div><p><span>e) </span>These Terms &amp; Conditions can only be amended in writing and deemed effective if agreed upon by the Translator and the Client.</p></div><div><p><span>f) </span>Any communication concerning translation and/or proofreading services shall be in writing and sent by post or e-mail to the address of the relevant party.</p></div><div><p><span>g) </span>The English version of these Terms &amp; Conditions shall always prevail.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">2. Quotations &amp; Conclusion of Contracts</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>Before concluding a contract, the Translator will provide the Client with a quotation containing all information relevant to the translation and/or proofreading services, such as the format of delivery, anticipated delivery date(s) (see s 3(a), s 3(b) and s 6(a)) and fees. All fees will exclude possible delivery costs and taxes; if such delivery costs or taxes arise, they will be added in due course.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>All quotations are free of obligation.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>The contract shall be deemed concluded when both the Translator and the Client have provided written confirmation of the translation and/or proofreading services to be executed.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">3. Cancellation of or Changes to Contracts</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>Any major changes made by the Client to the translation and/or proofreading services after the contract has been concluded shall entitle the Translator to revise fees and/or terms of delivery.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>The Translator reserves the right to revise fees and/or terms of delivery if (i) she was unable to see the entire text to be translated/proofread prior to the conclusion of the contract and/or (ii) it becomes clear that the terms of the contract do not reflect the true nature of the said text (regarding, in particular, the scope and type of text, the level of difficulty and so forth). In such cases, the said revision does not entitle the Client to any compensation.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>If the Client is unable to meet his/her obligations (including, but not limited to, cases involving bankruptcy, liquidation or a moratorium in respect of the Client's business), the Translator reserves the right to either (i) cancel the contract (in part or in full) or (ii) postpone its execution without any obligation to pay damages. In such cases, the Client will be liable to pay for (iii) translation and/or proofreading work already completed and (iv) research already carried out in connection with the remainder of the translation and/or proofreading services (charged on an hourly basis; see section 7). The Translator will place the work already completed at the Client’s disposal.</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>If the Client cancels the contract, s 3(c)(iii) and s 3(c)(iv) shall apply.  </p></div><div><p><span>e) </span>If the Translator has reserved time for cancelled translation and/or proofreading services and is unable to put it to other gainful use, the Client shall be required to pay 50% of the fees concerning the services not carried out.</p></div><div><p><span>f) </span>If the Translator is unable to meet her obligations due to circumstances beyond her reasonable control, she reserves the right to cancel the contract without any obligation to pay damages. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: fires, accidents, illnesses, strikes, riots, wars, transport restrictions and delays, government measures, Internet disruptions and other instances of force majeure.</p></div><div><p><span>g) </span>The cancellation of or any changes to the contract must be in writing.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">4. Execution of Translation/Proofreading Services &amp; Client Obligations</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>The Translator undertakes to execute the translation and/or proofreading services to the best of her ability for the purposes specified by the Client.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>Upon request and where possible, the Client shall supply any relevant information about the text to be translated/proofread as well as documentation and terminology, if available. Such materials shall be dispatched at the Client's expense and risk. The Translator shall not be liable for mistakes or delays resulting from the insufficient or delayed provision of such information.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>If there are any unclear passages in the text to be translated/proofread, the Translator will try to clarify their meaning with the Client or, if this is not possible, realise the translation and/or proofreading to the best of her ability.</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>The Client is responsible for copyright issues concerning the text to be translated/proofread (incl. images) and for ensuring that the material may be edited legally (see s 11(b)).</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">5. Data Protection &amp; Confidentiality</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>The Translator undertakes to treat all information provided by the Client as strictly confidential, unless agreed upon otherwise in writing or required by Swiss law.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">6. Terms of Delivery</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>Although the Translator will do her best to respect agreed delivery dates, they are nevertheless provisional, unless agreed otherwise in writing. The Translator shall notify the Client immediately if she perceives that she will be unable to deliver work on time.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>If the Translator fails to respect an agreed delivery date for reasons excluding those beyond her control and the Client cannot reasonably be expected to brook any delay, the Client shall be entitled to cancel the contract. In such cases, however, the Translator shall not be liable to pay any damages, and s 3(d) shall be applicable.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>Work shall be deemed delivered at the time it is sent.</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>The Client is to confirm receipt of work in writing as soon as possible.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">7. Calculation of Fees</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>Fees shall be calculated based on the length and complexity of the text to be translated and/or proofread. The fees specified in the contract are, therefore, provisional and will be finalised after the translation and/or proofreading services have been completed in order to reflect the actual amount of work required.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>Unless agreed otherwise in writing, fees will be based on the Translator's rates (per word, per line or per hour). Fixed prices may be negotiated for certain tasks. The Translator may also charge for expenses agreed in advance with the Client connected with the execution of the translation and/or proofreading services.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>Urgent translation and/or proofreading services will be subject to a surcharge of 25-100%.</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>If translation fees are calculated on a line basis, one line shall include 55 characters (incl. spaces). If the Client provides the source text in a non-editable format (such as a scanned, hand-written text), the fee calculation shall be based on the number of lines in the target text (Times New Roman; 12 points).</p></div><div><p><span>e) </span>All fees are exclusive of VAT.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">8. Payment</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>Depending on the translation and/or proofreading services, the Translator may require (i) all or part of the fees in advance, (ii) instalments during the course of the work and/or (iii) an initial security, such as a bank guarantee. If the Client fails to fulfil such payment obligations, the Translator reserves the right (iv) to suspend all services and/or terminate the contract and (v) to claim compensation for any work already carried out.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>Payment is to be settled within 15 working days of the invoice date (settlement means received by the Translator). Clients are responsible for anticipating holidays, week-ends and other factors influencing the dispatch and receipt of bank transfers. </p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>Clients whose payment is not received within 15 working days of the invoice date will receive payment reminders, the amount due being increased by 10% for the first reminder and by 15% for the second reminder (see s 8(a)(iv) and s 8(a)(v)).</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>The Client is to cover any fees associated with bank transfers and/or differing currencies.</p></div><div><p><span>e) </span>Payments shall be accepted in CHF and EUR.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">9. Complaints</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>The Client is to notify the Translator of any complaints concerning the delivered work in writing within 10 working days of delivery. Complaints shall not release the Client from his/her obligation to pay.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>If the complaint is valid, the Translator will correct or replace the work within a reasonable period of time or, if the Translator cannot reasonably comply with the Client’s wishes, will adjust fees accordingly.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>The Client's right to complain shall lapse if the Client has modified or has had modified the delivered work concerned in the complaint, regardless of whether or not the Client has subsequently supplied the work to a third party.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">10. Limitation of Liability</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>The Translator shall be exclusively liable for damage directly and demonstrably deriving from shortcomings attributable to her. The Translator shall under no circumstances be liable for other forms of direct or indirect loss or damage. The Translator's liability shall never exceed the amount invoiced for the translation and/or proofreading services, exclusive of VAT.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>Ambiguity of the text to be translated/proofread shall release the Translator from any liability.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>The assessment as to whether the text to be translated/proofread and/or the translated/proofread version entails any risk shall be entirely at the Client's expense and risk.</p></div><div><p><span>d) </span>The Translator shall not be liable for damage to or loss of documents, information or data carriers provided by the Client for the purposes of the translation and/or proofreading services.</p></div><div><p><span>e) </span>The Client shall indemnify the Translator against any claims by third parties deriving from the use of the delivered work.</p></div><div><p><span>f) </span>The Translator shall not be liable for damages resulting from changes effected in the delivered work by the Client or third parties.</p></div><div><p><span>g) </span>The Translator shall not be liable for the legal and technical correctness of the text to be translated/proofread.</p></div><div><p><span>h) </span>The Translator shall not be liable for damage to or loss of work during delivery (via e-mail or by post). The Translator shall also not be liable for possible delivery delays caused by such incidents.</p></div><p></p></div><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">11. Copyright</h3><p></p><div><p><span>a) </span>Unless agreed otherwise in writing, the Translator retains the copyright on translations and texts she produces.</p></div><div><p><span>b) </span>The Client shall indemnify the Translator against any claims from third parties regarding alleged violation of property rights, patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights in connection with the execution of the translation and/or proofreading services.</p></div><div><p><span>c) </span>If a translation is published in print or on the Internet, the name of the Translator and her function as the translator of the published text must be mentioned in a visible manner. In the case of publication on the Internet, a link to the Translator’s website must also be included. Prior to the final publication, a proof copy must be sent to the Translator for approval.</p></div><p></p></div><h2 class="has-text-centered is-size-5"><span class="brand-red">Teaching Services</span></h2><div><h3 class="mt-4 is-size-5">1.
